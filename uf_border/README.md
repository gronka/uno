# uf_border

uf_border handles outgoing messages. Incoming messages are handled by uf_public

hooks will "logs in" the user for a temporary session in which it will execute the single message that the user has sent

# TODO

1. What happens if a user sends many messages? Should we create a working queue 
for each user?
